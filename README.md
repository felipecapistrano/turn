# ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project was just a proof of concept to see if it was possible to create a decent game using the React + Redux stack.

What it is: An tactics RPG based on Final Fantasy Tactics.

Objective: See if I could implement the core gameplay.

Conclusion: It is possible to some extent, but it's better to just use a game focused library.
